### Objectives

-   After completing this lab, you should be able to create an Exadata VM cluster and an Oracle Database on Oracle Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure using the OCI Console.


### Prerequisites

This lab requires completion of the following:

* Successful Login to a Tenancy with a service limit assigned for the **Oracle Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure**

## Task 1: Create an Exadata VM Cluster Resource on Oracle Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure 

1. Open the navigation menu. Under **Oracle Database**, click **Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure**.

  ![Navigate to Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure](./images/console-to-exadb-xs.png" ")

2. In the left rail, **VM Clusters** is selected by default. Under **List Scope**, Select your compartment. 
   
  ![Select Compartment where VM Cluster will reside](./images/select-compartment.png" ")

3. Click the **Create VM Cluster** button. 
  
  ![Click Create VM Cluster](./images/click-create-vm-cluster.png" ")
    
    This causes the **Create VM Cluster** page to be displayed.  

4. **Provide the basic information to configure the Exadata VM cluster**.
    * For **Compartment**: Ensure that the compartment that you want the VM Cluster to be created in is displayed.

    * For **Display Name**: Enter ***MyDemoVMCluster*** 

    * For **Cluster Name**: Enter ***MyDemoClus*** 

    * For **Availability Domain**: Select the availability domain from the displayed options available.

        * For **Total ECPUs per VM:** Provide a total number of ECPUs to allocate per VM. ***Enter 12***.  
        * The **ECPUs additional reserved per VM** field which is (read only) will now indicate that there are now **4 reserved ECPUs**. 
    * The **Memory per VM (GB)** field which is (read only) will display the amount of memory allocated to each VM. <br/> 
    ***Memory is calculated based on 2.75 GB per total ECPU***. 

      <u>**Size the VM file system storage**</u>: 
    * For system storage capacity per VM (GG): ***Enter 280***

      **Note:**  The VM Filesystems storage includes /u02 capacity, where your Database Homes will go, along with all of the other VM filesystems (/, /boot, /tmp, /var, /var/log, /var/log/audit, /home, swap, kdump, /u01, grid, /u02). Any extra capacity selected beyond system minimums will go into /u02.

    * **Grid Infrastructure Release and Version fields:** display the Oracle Grid Infrastructure versions available for deployment in the VM cluster. <br/>
    ***Accept the default values for the 23ai release***.

    * **Add your SSH Key for future access to your VMs**. <u>Choose from:</u>

        * **Generate SSH key pair**(Default option) Select this option to generate an SSH keypair. Then in the dialog below click Save private key to download the key, and optionally click Save public key to download the key. 
        * **Upload SSH key files**: Select this option to browse or drag and drop .pub files. 
        * **Paste SSH keys:** Select this option to paste in individual public keys.

8. **To Configure the network settings, Select VCN and select Client and Backup subnet** 
    * **For the Virtual Cloud Network (VCN):** Select the ***virtual cloud network (VCN)*** for the compartment in which you want to create the VM cluster. Click ***Change Compartment*** to select a VCN in a different compartment.
    
    * **For the Client subnet:** Select the ***client subnet*** in the compartment. This is the subnet to which the VM cluster should attach. Click ***Change Compartment*** to select a subnet in a different compartment.
    
    * **For the Backup Subnet:** Select the subnet to use for the ***backup network***, which is typically used to transport backup information to and from the Backup Destination, and for Data Guard replication. Click ***Change Compartment*** to select a subnet in a different compartment, if applicable.
    
    * **For the Hostname Prefix:** Enter the hostname

  ![Configure Network Settings](./images/configure-network-settings.png" ")

9. **Select license type & choose opt-in choices for Diagnostic & Collections options.**
    * **Choose a license type:** The type of license that you want to use for the VM cluster. Your choice affects metering for billing. Select the ***Bring Your Own License (BYOL)*** OR ***License Included*** option.

  ![Choose VM Cluster License Type](./images/choose-license-type.png" ")

10. **Select Diagnostic and Collections Options**
In the Edit Diagnostics Collection Settings dialog, you can enable or disable any of the Diagnostics Collections options. By enabling diagnostics collection and notifications, Oracle Cloud Operations and you will be able to identify, investigate, track, and resolve guest VM issues quickly and effectively. ***Accept the default values***.
    * **Enable Diagnostics Events:** Allows Oracle to collect and publish critical, warning, error, and information events to me. For more information, see Overview of Database Service Events
