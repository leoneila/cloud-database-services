# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop is designed to provide you with hands on experience using the Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure, which is Oracle’s next generation architecture of the Exadata Database Service. 

In this workshop, you will use several of the OCI management interfaces to conduct various database lifecycle tasks on the Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure.  

The workshop exercises are designed to provide you with operational experience creating & managing the Exascale Storage Vault, the Exadata VM Cluster, Container Databases, Pluggable Databases, and thin clones that leverage the Exascale technology stack.

You will also learn how to configure alerts and notifications for events that we will trigger during some of the workshop lab tasks. 

Don’t miss your chance to be one of the first to gain hand-on experience with Exadata & the Exascale technology stack.


**Estimated Workshop Time:** ***3 hours***


### **Oracle Exadata Exascale: World’s Only Intelligent Data Architecture for Cloud**


Exadata Exascale is Oracle’s revolutionary multitenant architecture that combines the intelligence of Exadata with all the benefits of modern clouds. This loosely-coupled architecture incorporates the Exascale intelligent storage cloud and a pool of Exascale database-optimized compute to provide hyper-elasticity while meeting even the most demanding workload requirements.

When running Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure, you have access to its intelligent capabilities across your application portfolio. Database-optimized intelligent infrastructure runs AI, analytics, mission-critical OLTP, and developer workloads faster and more efficiently, reducing overall IT costs. Some of these capabilities include:

* Intelligent AI: The combination of AI Smart Scan with Exadata System Software 24ai offloads key AI Vector Search operations to the Exascale intelligent storage cloud, enabling massive amounts of vector data to be searched up to 30X faster.

* Intelligent analytics: The combination of intelligent columnarization and Smart Scan make hundreds or thousands of processing cores in the Exascale intelligent storage cloud available to process any SQL query.

* Intelligent OLTP: Exascale’s intelligent architecture automatically tiers data between DRAM, flash, and disk enabling low-latency, high-throughput Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) to frequently accessed data and delivers the performance of DRAM, the IOPS of flash, and the capacity of disk.

* Database-aware intelligent clones:The Exascale intelligent storage cloud uses redirect-on-write snapshot technology to instantly create space-efficient database clones from read-write sources.

Starting today, you can enjoy Exadata Database Service benefits at a lower entry cost for smaller, but no less critical, databases. Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure bridges the gap between dedicated Exadata infrastructure and virtual machines on shared commodity infrastructure. It extends Exadata’s advantages to every organization in every industry, regardless of size or workload.

You can start small using virtual machine (VM) cluster configurations with as little as 8 ECPUs and 22 GB of memory per VM, and 300 GB of intelligent database storage. You can easily scale up the number of ECPUs and number of VMs in the cluster, and then shrink them when you don’t need them. To ensure ECPU capacity is available when you need it, you can reserve ECPUs at a nominal cost.
