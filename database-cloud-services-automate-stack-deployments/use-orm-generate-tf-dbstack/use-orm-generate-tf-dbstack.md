# Use OCI Resource Manager to generate and deploy Terraform for Application and Database Stack


## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to generate and deploy Terraform for Application and Database stack using OCI Resource Manage.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes


### Objectives

-   After completing this lab, you should be able to generate and deploy Terraform for Application and Database stack using OCI Resource Manager.


### Prerequisites

This lab requires the completion of the following:

* Completion of **Lab4**

## Task 1: Generate Terraform baseline configuration for Database development environment using OCI Resource Manager

1. Open the navigation menu and click **Developer Services**. Under **Resource Manager**, click **Stacks**.
   
   ![Launch ORM Stacks](./images/oci-menu-orm.png " ")

2. On the **Stacks** page, select your assigned compartment.

3. Click **Create stack**.

4. On the **Create stack** page, under **Choose the origin of the Terraform configuration**, select **Existing compartment**.

5. Select your assigned **compartment** and assigned **region** containing the Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer Resource Model.

    ![select compartment for resource discovery](./images/orm-create-stack-from-compartment.png " ")

   This will create a stack that captures resources from the selected assigned compartment using **OCI Resource Manager (resource discovery)**

6. Select the service types that you want to be discovered for your terraform script by: Selecting **Selected** for the Terraform provider services and then selecting **database** for the services value. 
   
    ![Select compartment to create stack](./images/orm-discover-dbstack.png " ")
   
7. Provide the **Name** for your stack and Select the **compartment** where you want to create the stack.
   
    >**Note:** For this lab, use **MyTFBaseline-Database** for the name of your discovered database stack and use your assigned compartment for the **Create in compartment**

    ![Create your discovered database stack](./images/orm-create-stack.png " ")

    

8. Click **Next** twice. No variables are listed for the Existing compartment stack origin because no Terraform configuration exists yet.

9.  In the Review panel, verify the stack configuration. Take note of the Terraform version for future use on your stack deployment.

    ![Create database stack](./images/orm-create-stack-database.png " ")

10. Click **Create**.
    
    

11. Once the newly created stack is available, Download a copy of the generated Terraform script by clicking on the **Download** link next to **Terraform configuration**.

    ![Download database stack](./images/orm-download-dbstack.png " ")

    After downloading the zip file, you can unzip the file and view the generated Terraform configuration file in your text or code editor. 

    View the *database.tf* file. 

    >**Note:** Your database's generated baseline terraform code is similar to the output below. *Resources discovered in the Baseline Terraform configuration will be presented and discussed by the speakers*. Notes are added on each section of the discovered Exadata Database Service Resource Model

    This is the discovered resource for the **Custom Database Software image**

## Task 2: Deploy Gold Image Stack (Database and MyDesktop Application) using OCI Resource Manager and Terraform

1. In the Breadcrumb link, Click on **Stacks** then select your assigned **compartment** and Click **Create stack**.

    ![Deploy App and DB Stack](./images/orm-deploy-app-dbstack.png " ")

2. On the **Create stack** page, under Choose the origin of the Terraform configuration, select **My configuration**.

   Select **.Zip file** for the Terraform configuration source. then browse your desktop for a file called **SampleTF.zip** and then click **Next**. 
   
   
    ![Upload zip file to deploy App and DB Stack](./images/orm-deploy-app-dbstack-from-zip.png " ")


3. Select your assigned **compartment** where you want to create the stack.

4. For Terraform version, select the version used by the Terraform configuration.

5. Click **Next**. In the Configure variables panel, review the variables listed from the Terraform configuration and change them as needed.

6. In the **Review** panel, verify the stack configuration.

7. Click **Create** to establish your customized stack.

    >**Note:** Now that we have a defined stack, let's prepare to use the stack to deploy a new developer environment consisting of an Application Server and 1 Exadata Container Database and 3 Pluggable Databases. 
    
8. Create Stack Deployment Plan by: Clicking on **Plan** on the Stack details page. In the Plan panel, use **MyAppDBStackPlan** for the Plan name and then Click on **Plan** to proceed. 
   
    >**Note:** The plan job is created and is listed under Jobs. 
   
    
9. Process Stack Deployment Plan by clicking on **Apply**. In the Apply panel, edit the default name for the job. For this lab, we will use **MyAppDBStackApply** for the Apply name. 
    
10. Click on **Apply**. 
    
    >**Note:** This will cause the apply job to be created and our new stack to be deployed once the job completes.
