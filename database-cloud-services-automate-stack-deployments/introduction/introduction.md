# Introduction

## About this Workshop

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to automate the deployment of database environments that will run on the Oracle Database Cloud Services using the OCI Management interfaces (OCI Console, CLI, APIs, SDKs, and Terraform). 

Gain hands-on experience on how to create standard images, discover & capture gold environment images, and use automation to deploy standardized environment stacks.

Estimated Workshop Time: 70 minutes

**OCI Management Interfaces for Database Cloud Services**

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides a wide choice of management interfaces that can be used with Oracle Database Cloud Services.  

![OCI Management Interfaces](./images/oci-mngmt-interfaces.png " ")

The easiest to use is the **OCI web console user interface (UI)**, which allows you to use a browser to graphically configure and initiate operations.  

The web console is great for one-time actions, but most users prefer a more programmatic interface for executing things that are done repeatedly, such as provisioning, managing resources and maintenance updates.  

Any operation that you can do with the web console, you can also do with a corresponding **REST API**.  
Similar to the web console, the REST APIs transit the Internet via https, and require no special software to be installed on the local system.  

All of the operations interfaces are also exposed via a command line interface (CLI) using **OCI CLI** that can be used for scripting, and for building custom tooling.

There is a **Software Development Kit (SDK)** that allows you to integrate with common languages such as Java, Python, Ruby, and Go.  

If you prefer to manage your **Infrastructure as Code**, there are also Terraform and Ansible interfaces available. 


**What is an Oracle Exadata Database Service?**

Oracle Exadata Database Service is a high-performance co-managed Oracle Cloud Database service that allows organizations to run databases with extreme performance, availability, and security cost-effectively. Databases run faster and with fewer resources on scale-out Exadata infrastructure that includes unique optimizations for transaction processing, analytics, and mixed workloads. Online scaling of computing resources enables customers to quickly adjust consumption to match workload demands without interrupting operations, while efficient database consolidation further lowers total costs. Full compatibility with on-premises Oracle Database and Exadata environments makes it easy for customers to migrate workloads to the cloud.

Exadata Database Service allows you to leverage the power of Exadata in the cloud. Exadata Database Service’s scale-out architecture allows customers to provision more compute and storage independently easily, right-sizing their service to meet growing demands. Exadata Database Service offer RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) networking for high bandwidth and low latency, persistent memory (PMEM) modules, and intelligent Exadata software.

Built-in Oracle Maximum Availability Architecture (Oracle MAA) best practices increase database availability, Exadata Database Service reduces downtime and simplifies operational management with zero downtime maintenance, online scaling, and one-click provisioning of Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) and Oracle Active Data Guard using built-in cloud automation


**What is an Oracle Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer?**

Oracle Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer enables you to apply the combined power of Oracle Exadata and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure inside your own data center. You have full access to the features and capabilities of Oracle Database along with the intelligent performance and scalability of Oracle Exadata, but with Oracle owning and managing the Exadata infrastructure. You can use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console and APIs to manage Oracle Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer just as with any other cloud resource, while maintaining absolute sovereignty over your data.

Oracle Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer is the simplest way to move an organization’s business-critical Oracle Database workloads to the cloud. It simultaneously runs Oracle Exadata Database Service and the fully managed Oracle Autonomous Database Service inside customers’ data centers and behind their firewalls to help meet strict data residency and security requirements.

These hands-on lab guides provide step-by-step directions to Learn how to automate the deployment of database environments that will run on the Oracle Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer using the OCI Management interfaces (OCI Console, CLI, APIs, SDKs, and Terraform). 

Gain hands-on experience on how to create standard images, discover & capture gold environment images, and use automation to deploy standardized environment stacks.
