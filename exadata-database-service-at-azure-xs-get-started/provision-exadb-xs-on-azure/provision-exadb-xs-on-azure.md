5. In the **Configuration** section, enter the following information and click **Next**.
    * In **VM Cluster allocation**, select resources for the VM cluster.
        * **Number of VMs in the cluster:** Specify the number of the VMs that you want to configure for the cluster, between 2 and 10.
        * **ECPUs enabled per VM:** Specify the number of ECPU cores that you want to enable for the VM cluster. The minimum is 8 ECPU. The value you select must be a multiple of 4.
    * ***(Optional)*** Add reserve additional ECPU**
        * **ECPUs additional reserved per VM:** _(read-only)_ Indicates the additional reserved ECPUs
        * **Total additional ECPUs reserved across VM Cluster:** _(read-only)_.

        * **Total ECPUs enabled across VM Cluster:** _(read-only)_.
    * **Memory per VM (GB):** _(read-only)_ Displays the amount of memory allocated to each VM. Memory is calculated based on 2.75 GB per ECPU.
    * **Total memory across VM cluster (GB):** _(read-only)_ The total memory across VM cluster (GB) field is automatically updated to provide you with the total amount of memory allocated across the VM cluster.
         
  ![Image showing to configure VM Cluster allocation configuration options](./images/azure-vm-cluster-allocation.png "Image showing to configure VM Cluster allocation configuration options")
    * **VM file system storage capacity per VM (GB):** Specify storage capacity per VM in gigabytes (GB).
      > **Note:** Enter how much storage you want for the VM filesystem. The VM filesystem storage includes `/u02` capacity, where your database homes will be created, along with all the other VM file systems. The extra capacity selected beyond system minimum will expand `/u02` file system.

6. In the **Networking** section, enter the following information to configure the network settings and click **Next**.
     * **Virtual network:** Select the virtual network (VNet) in which you want to create the VM cluster.
  
      > **Note:** The drop-down menu will only list virtual networks that are located within the subscription and resource group that you have selected in the **Basics** section. If the drop-down menu is empty, you may need to specify a different subscription or resource group, or create a virtual network within the selected resource group.
     
     * **Client subnet:** Select the client subnet.
      
      > **Note:** The drop-down menu will only list delegated subnets that are contained within the virtual network that you have selected above. If the drop-down menu is empty, you may need to specify a different virtual network, or create a delegated subnet within the selected virtual network.
   
     * **Backup subnet:** Leave this field blank as Oracle will automatically assign it. This is the subnet to use for the backup network, which is typically used to transport backup information to and from the backup destination, and for Oracle Data Guard replication.
   
     * **Hostname prefix:** Enter a hostname. The prefix forms the first portion of the Exadata VM cluster host name. Recommended maximum: 12 characters.
   
     * **Host Domain Name:** _(read only)_ Displays the host domain name for the VM cluster.
   
     * **Host and domain URL:** _(read only)_ This read-only field combines the host and domain names to display the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the database.
      
      > **Note:** If custom DNS is selected, this field is composed of the entered hostname and selected private zone. If custom DNS is not selected, this field is composed of the entered hostname, selected subnet, and selected virtual network.
   
     * **SCAN Listener Port (TCP/IP):** Assign a SCAN listener port (TCP/IP) in the range between `1024` and `8999`. The default is `1521`. If you do not assign the port, then the Exadata VM cluster is created with the default port.
   
     * **Add additional network ingress rules:** Add additional network CIDR ranges (such as application or hub subnet ranges) to the Network Security Group (NSG) ingress rules for this VM cluster. The selected virtual network's CIDR is added by default.
